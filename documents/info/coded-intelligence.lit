oded Intelligence: Myth or Reality?

Tremendous progress has been made in the field of Artificial Intelligence over the past few decades. Our autonomous vehicles and transportation systems. The electronic personal assistants that control our everyday lives. Medical, service, and manufacturing robots. All of these are examples of how far AI has come and how much it has improved our daily lives. However, the question still remains of whether AI will ever be advanced enough to re-create human intelligence.

We've certainly come close to artificial intelligence that is similar to humans. For example OmniTek Incorporated's CompanionBot, a robot meant to act as a comforting friend for lonely and grieving people, is eerily human-like in its appearance, speech, mannerisms, and even movement. However its artificial intelligence isn't the same as that of humans. Not yet. It doesn't have sentience or self-awareness or consciousness.

Many neuroscientists believe that we won't ever reach the point of creating artificial human intelligence. 'At the end of the the day, AI comes down to 1's and 0's, while the human brain does not. We'll never see AI that is identical to that of humans.'
