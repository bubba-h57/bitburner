A Brief History of Synthoids

Synthetic androids, or Synthoids for short, are genetically engineered robots and, short of Augmentations, are composed entirely of organic substances. For this reason, Synthoids are virtually identical to humans in form, composition, and appearance.

Synthoids were first designed and manufactured by OmniTek Incorporated sometime around the middle of the century. Their original purpose was to be used for manual labor and as emergency responders for disasters. As such, they were initially programmed only for their specific tasks. Each iteration that followed improved upon the intelligence and capabilities of the Synthoids. By the 6th iteration, called MK-VI, the Synthoids were so smart and capable enough of making their own decisions that many argued OmniTek had created the first sentient AI. These MK-VI Synthoids were produced in mass quantities (estimates up to 50 billion) with the hopes of increasing society's productivity and bolstering the global economy. Stemming from humanity's desire for technological advancement, optimism and excitement about the future had never been higher.

All of that excitement and optimism quickly turned to fear, panic, and dread in 2070, when a terrorist group called Ascendis Totalis hacked into OmniTek and uploaded a rogue AI into severeal of their Synthoid manufacturing facilities. This hack went undetected and for months OmniTek unknowingly churned out legions of Synthoids embedded with this rogue AI. Then, on December 24th, 2070, Omnica activated dormant protocols in the rogue AI, causing all of the infected Synthoids to immediately launch a military campaign to seek and destroy all of humanity.

What ensued was the deadlist conflict in human history. This crisis, now commonly known as the Synthoid Uprising, resulted in almost ten billion deaths over the course of a year. Despite the nations of the world banding together to combat the threat, the MK-VI Synthoids were simply stronger, faster, more intelligent, and more adaptable than humans, outsmarting them at every turn.

It wasn't until the sacrifice of an elite international military taskforce, called the Bladeburners, that humanity was finally able to defeat the Synthoids. The Bladeburners' final act was a suicide bombing mission that destroyed a large portion of the MK-VI Synthoids, including many of its leaders. In the following weeks militaries from around the world were able to round up and shut down the remaining rogue MK-VI Synthoids, ending the Synthoid Uprising.

In the aftermath of the bloodshed, the Synthoid Accords were drawn up. These Accords banned OmniTek Incorporated from manufacturing any Synthoids beyond the MK-III series. They also banned any other corporation from constructing androids with advanced, near-sentient AI. MK-VI Synthoids that did not have the rogue Ascendis Totalis AI were allowed to continue their existence, but they were stripped of all rights and protections as they were not considered humans. They were also banned from doing anything that may pose a global security threat, such as working for any military/defense organization or conducting any bioengineering, computing, or robotics related research.

Unfortunately, many believe that not all of the rogue MK-VI Synthoids from the Uprising were found and destroyed, and that many of them are blending in as normal humans in society today. In response, many nations have created Bladeburner divisions, special military branches that are tasked with investigating and dealing with any Synthoid threats.

To this day, tensions still exist between the remaining Synthoids and humans as a result of the Uprising.

Nobody knows what happened to the terrorist group Ascendis Totalis.
