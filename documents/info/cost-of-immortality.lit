The Cost of Immortality

Evolution and advances in medical and augmentation technology has lead to drastic improvements in human mortality rates. Recent figures show that the life expectancy for humans that live in a first-world country is about 130 years of age, almost double of what it was at the turn of the century. However, this increase in average lifespan has had some significant effects on society and culture.

Due to longer lifespans and a better quality of life, many adults are holding off on having kids until much later. As a result, the percentage of youth in first-world countries has been decreasing, while the number of senior citizens is significantly increasing.

Perhaps the most alarming result of all of this is the rapidly shrinking workforce. Despite the increase in life expectancy, the typical retirement age for workers in America has remained about the same, meaning a larger and larger percentage of people in America are retirees. Furthermore, many young adults are holding off on joining the workforce because they feel that they have plenty of time left in their lives for employment, and want to 'enjoy life while they're young.' For most industries, this shrinking workforce is not a major issue as most things are handled by robots anyways. However, there are still several key industries such as engineering and education that have not been automated, and these remain in danger to this cultural phenomenon.
